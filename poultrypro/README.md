##  Workflow Summary (Flow of Work)
1. **Home Page** – User selects their role: *Farmer* or *Seller*.
2. **Farmer Dashboard** – Enter chicken and resource data → System displays charts and summaries.
3. **Seller Dashboard** – View farmers’ progress → Choose to initiate a purchase or view detailed stats.
4. **Data Flow** – Handled entirely on the client side (use of React `useState` and mock JSON for now).
5. **UI Feedback** – Toast messages for actions like record update or interest submission.

##  Future Enhancements
